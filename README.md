# Code review checklist
- Be polite / friendly / honest / frank / humble
- Are we introducing a CLEAN code?
- The PR should be concentrated on a particular goal
  - If the goal of a PR is **NOT** clear to reviewers, arrange an over-shoulder code review session
- The PR should be **LESS** than `400` lines of code
- Design patterns?
- JIRA ticket mentioned?
- Code formatting & static code analysis:
  - SonarQube checks passed?
  - Is IntelliJIDEA code formatter applied?
- DRY / YAGNI / SOLID?
- Is it the right layer of an architecture? Should this fix be dumped somewhere in a better place?
- Any best practices we can use to do the same thing?
- Commit message is EXTREMELY important
- Non-functional requirements:
  - Readability
  - Security
  - Performance
  - Deployment
  - Documentation
  - Portability
- Ask good questions & don't make demands (e.g. "What do you think about naming this `:user_id?`")
- Always be patient and relook if required
- What kind of troubles we are going to introduce with this fix / PR?
- Tests:
  - Do we have tests that cover an introduced functionality?
  - Is it enough to have only unit tests in this case? End-to-end tests? Integration tests? UI tests?
- Backward compatibility
- If you introduce a brand new dependency check that it is NOT introduced by somebody before you
  - Check the shared / parent POM-s & projects
  - Transitive dependencies
- Sign off on the pull request with a üëç / LGTM / "Ready to be merged" comment
